@stakeholder Here are the key findings and questions from working with the users, receipts, and brands datasets.
Through my analysis and validation checks, I found several data quality issues:
- Our brands and receipt items seem to use different barcode standards - brands consistently use a '51111' prefix while receipt items follow various formats. This impacts our ability to reliably match brands across systems.
- When validating price calculations, I found cases where final_price doesn't match item_price * quantity_purchased, suggesting either special pricing rules I'm unaware of or potential data issues.
- There are "orphaned" receipts in our system - receipts with no associated line items, possibly due to data capture issues.

To properly address these and build a robust data model, I'd love to understand:
1. business context
- What are the KPIs and analyses your team needs from this data? 
- What's the required freshness for the data? Does the refresh need to complete by specific time of the day?
2. data concerns:
- What's the expected format for barcodes across our system? Or is there documentation on how they should map between datasets?
- Do we have any existing rules for standardizing brand names?
- Are there specific date ranges we should focus on, or any historical data cutoff points I should be aware of?

I'm also thinking ahead about scalability as we grow:
- The receipts and items data will grow significantly faster than other tables
- I anticipate slowing query performance as we start joining these large datasets
- Frequent refreshes of larger data volumes could impact database performance

Would you have 30 minutes this week to discuss these points? This will ensure we build a system that meets the immediate analytics needs but also scales with our growth.
Happy to provide specific examples or dig deeper into any of the above.
